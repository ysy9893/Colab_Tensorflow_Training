# Colab_Tensorflow_Training
This is the tutorial for training tensorflow object detection classifier in colab 

The original tutorial (https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API-Tutorial-Train-Multiple-Objects-Windows-10) is for people using window os and gpu supported pc. However, this tutorial referring most parts of original tutorial would support all os and who don't have any gpu supported pc in their households!!!

You can download train_tf.ipynb from this repository and just open it using Colab Notebooks ^^

I had implemented transfer learning on pretrined mobilenet_ssd_v2 model using my own dataset. 

There are 3 classes (car, motorcycle, human) and 11220 trainable images. 

The result of model testing on mp4 video:
